## DevOps

Serverless means no (or few) back-end developers and now Front End devs do DevOps. 

## Normal release to production.

Devs normally develops on Local, Dev and then release a branch to Staging. Staging has release.text in root.
DevOps then zips the Staging and does:

      mbakeX --bakeP .

The internal code will the recompile targeting the production endpoints. In general person that released to staging should not be the same that release to production.

### Bugs in Production

So any normal release does the above release.
And if there are bugs on staging, mostly a new git branch is made from MASTER.

#### Sometimes there are IRREGULAR bug fixes in production (branch) 

Bugs are reproduced in DEV on the branch and fixed in MASTER. Then the bug fixes is added to the branch (so fix is both in MASTER and the released production branch). Staging will then be 'rolled back' to the fixed production branch - that contains the fix. And tested in staging.
Then ZIPed and copied to PROD: X --bakeP.


### Using
Load devops scripts in a closure, assume they are not 100% uptime.

Most should be loaded last, favor UX load times. For example after DOM plus 100ms.

Don't have devOps code in random places. 
 You can load a fragment via Pug flag in Production only, not local or dev:
 
 ```
   mbakeX --bakeWP .
 ```
 Fragment should be called devOps.pug, included before MASTERFrag.

## Levels of DevOps

All levels include weekly backup to NAS.

Make sure that devops files are disabled in local and DEV. They are only for Production. 

# Bronze LEVEL

- StatCounter.

## Waterfall

- http://gtmetrix.com


## Emulators (ie11 and older iOS)

Of course everyone tests locally on IE 11, FF, iOS, Safari, Android, etc.

- Browserstack account: to test IE 11, iOS and such.


## Pings

- RUM vendors

## Site tracking (Marketing)

This is only used for websites, not Web Apps.

People often ask for Google Analytics. That is for full time marketing analysts only: whose jobs is full time use of it. 
It is to be avoided.

- http://clicky.com . Click and Monitis can also do pints.
- https://www.monitis.com . Here available Uptime monitors, to check if app is down.

## Errors

- http://sentry.io
If there are errors reported, dev ops just adds them to issue tracker daily. Even if duplicate issue.


# Silver LEVEL

## SEO Console

Websites get registered with Google WebMaster tools, and Clicky advanced

### QUnit

If you have a ViewModel layer, you should test user going across pages by 'opening' VideModel in sequence. Also, it improves code to make VM testable.

#### This does not avoid need for QA resource and should only be used to supplement a Product side's QA resource.

Testing services layer ot View has much less benefits.


## RUM and Page/Screen Loads 

These are 3 different things, but same vendor provides all 3, and waterfall:



# Gold LEVEL

##  Native/Hybrid Web Apps

 RUM.

- Testing APIs

## Capacity / Preventive 1

** ViewModel and QUnit script. The script will try to stress.
Then open the QUnit test in a few browsers. So you triple the stress.


## Capacity / Preventive 2

External browser load generators. Rather than you writing your 

- LoadImpact is awesome. You may need to modify your code so it can be used, eg: expose to get. 

- But RUM, Synthetic transaction and Page/Screen Loads vendors provide load generators.

- Load testing: https://www.everystep-automation.com/pricing/
- LoadImpact.

#### CDN
- Also get CDN traffic samples via API


# Platinum LEVEL

- Synthetic transaction, provided by RUM vendors
